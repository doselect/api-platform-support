# API Platform Support

This is an **issue-only** repository meant for supporting users of DoSelect's API Platform. If you come across any feature requests, need any clarification on something from the [docs](https://docs.doselect.com), or have come across any bugs in general, please create an [issue](https://github.com/doselect/api-platform-support/issues/new) and someone from DoSelect will take a look at it at the earliest. 

## Requesting access to API Platform

The API Platform is under limited release at the moment. If you wish to use the API to integrate DoSelect's capabilities into your own app, please write to [DoSelect Support](mailto:support@doselect.com) and we shall get in touch with you. Kindly mention the scope of integration and your use-case in your email so we have better context when we talk.
